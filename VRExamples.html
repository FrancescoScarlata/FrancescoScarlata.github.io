				<p id="description"> 
				(These demos were shown on different events/marketing conferences)<br>
				I worked on different projects on different devices, some more ludo-oriented than others. The goal was usually to extract datas from the user about preferences etc. 
				<br>
				On HTC Vive the objective were multiple, like giving to the user a shopping experience plausible with the shelves made based on the different needs of the clients. Another was the vision an advertisement seated on a couch and with the eye tracked.
				The video shows instead some of the applications made on Oculus Quest, with different purposes. (These demos were shown on different events/marketing conferences)
				<br>
				<br>
				<span class="releaseDate">1. Brand Attribution</span> <br>
				The first point shows an experience where the users need to associate qualities to the brand fast, activating therefore the system 1 and giving more genuine answers. <br>
				<br><span class="releaseDate">2. Surveys </span><br>
				This point shows some of the capabilities of making the surveys in VR, with different questions. You can find here open questions (answered with the mic of the oculus itself), and various closed question with even branching possibilities based on the asnwers of the user.</span> <br>
				<br><span class="releaseDate">3. Surveys on shelves </span><br>
				Here there are questions similar to the point 2 but in front of a shelf. This differs from the HTC Vive type of questions for different reasons, like hardware requirements etc. The goal here is to show the product with the correct aspect ratios on a shelf to give the user an experience less plausible but more portable around for faster tests. <br>
				<br><span class="releaseDate">4. Data visualization </span><br>
				This was a part to give the user a feedback (when wanted) about the general answers given, not applicable on any case of course. <br>
				<br><span class="releaseDate">5. Clustering and groups </span><br>
				Here you can find some clustering made by the user when asked to group products by similarities, with following questions on the groups that they made.
