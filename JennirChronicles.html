				This demo was a "1 month" dev for the course of "Game and level design" erogated by the University of Milan. <br>
				The theme of that year was Star wars and in particular the lore on Jennir. The groups had to create a game that could fill the holes in which the actions of Jennir are unknown. <br>
				The demo shows the blocks of a mini-level of about 5/10 mins of a bandit's base, with all the details of the level written in the documentation. <br> 
				You can read the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/136AQY5q-Zt4VTCszUngMoV5Aq8hCdLk8/view?usp=sharing">LDD</a>, or see the git project <a href="https://github.com/FrancescoScarlata/JennirChronicles">here</a>.
				<br>
				This project was made by 3 people:
				<ol>
				<li>Francesco </li>
				<li>Davide  </li>
				<li>Maura</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				
				On this project i handled the design of the different settings, the goal outline, the maps and part of the area description in more detail. <br>
				On the demo i handled everything except the shooting/cross-hair and the puzzle interaction. (the camera and AI were taken from a template project given by the theachers as building blocks for the demo) <br>
				
				<br> <br>
				<strong> Note: </strong>
				This was my 3rd project overall with unity, we had no knowledge about git at the time the dev of the demo was between december 2016 and january 2017, with other courses exams in the way. The demo is not as polished as i'd like, but the design side seems good, if you'd like to give a look on that.
