				This is a prototype on the style of the duck game but that has different math questions as different type of terrains. This game can be played alone, or with other peolple in a turn based game.				
				<br>
				This was made as a dissertation project for the bachelor degree in Computer Science in around 4 months of development with other courses exams on the side. It's worth noting that this was my second game experience, and i didn't know a lot of stuff (both about designing and about unity) yet. You can read the whole dissertation (in italian) <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_O_JzAHFkB6RDRyTmJUTGVkUmc/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
				<br>
				<br>
				In short, This prototype was a sample of quizzes about math, expandible with other subjects, in which the players need to answer correctly to make more progress. In fact, if an answer is not correct, the turn will be pass to the next player, otherwise the player can roll the dice again, answer another question and so on. <br>
				The potential here is to learn while playing, and we know that this kind of competition is good between students.
